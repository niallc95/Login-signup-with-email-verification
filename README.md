# Login-signup-with-email-verification
Small PHP project that will take a users email and check the database to see if it has already been used. If it has not been used an email confirmation link is sent and the user account is created. This is a token based authentication system so if the email is already there a token is generated for 10 minutes and a link is also sent to the users email where he can get access to the site. This project was created as I was interested in exploring token based authentication and I felt a small PHP project would be a good way of exploring this
